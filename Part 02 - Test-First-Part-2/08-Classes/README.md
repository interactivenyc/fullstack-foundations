### 08 - Classes

The `class` exercises in TestFirst will challenge you in creating a Parent/Child relationship using `class` and subclass (`extends`) syntax using ES2015 syntax. In the exercises you will need to use:

- `class`
- `class Subclass extends ParentClass`
- add a `constructor` method to a class
- use the `super()` function in a `constructor` method of a Subclass

It is important to have an understanding of the prototype chain before completing these exercises.
